Here are notes when using homestead and vagrant to locally 
develop on your machine. This assumes that you have 
successfully installed Vagrant, VirtualBox and Homestead 
and set up your local environment:

1. Every time you run have to "vagrant up", you have to 
recreate the database ("atest");. To do so, 
go to the laravel project you are working on:
e.g. deco3800-atest/prototypeone. 
Then, run mysql -uHomestead -p. You'll get a prompt 
for the password, which is "secret". Then, 
you can run SHOW Databases to check the databases that 
currently exist. You have to then run "Create Database atest" 
(don't remember if you need quotes around atest). This should 
create the database for you. Then, you just migrate and seed and you're good to go.
